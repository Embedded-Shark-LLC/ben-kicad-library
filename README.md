KiCAD symbol and footprint libraries I've created for various projects

## Structure
Symbols and footprints are organized by manufacturer.  There is also a `Generic_Custom` symbol and footprint library for other parts that aren't specific to a manufacturer.

For downloaded 3D models that aren't licensed for upload to other sites, make a `3Dmodels_NOLICENSE` folder.  This folder will be untracked to help avoid license violations.
